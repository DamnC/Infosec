I patched the "mov eax, 1" instruction (that comes when the message is not valid) to a "mov eax, 0" instruction.
In hex, the "mov eax, 1" instruction is "b8 01 00 00 00". To patch it, I found the offset of the instruction (using ida), then changed the "01" to "00". Now it became "mov eax, 0".
It works since eax stores the return value when the program exits.
