I patched the "jnz short 0x17" instruction (that comes after the call to validate) to a jmp instruction.
In hex, the "jnz short 0x17" instruction is "75 17". To patch it, I found the offset of the instruction (using ida), then changed the "75" to "eb". Now it became "jmp short 0x17".
It works since the 0x17 offset is the "Valid msg" offset.
