I patched the second byte, and the first byte when needed (when the length in the first byte is bigger than the message).
I gave the second byte the value it should have (the wanted xor result), given the length in the first byte.
I did it by calculating the xor result like the program would have done, then patching the second byte with the correct value.
In case the length from the first byte was bigger than the message, I patched the length of the message instead.
