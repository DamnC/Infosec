Using ida, I discovered two dead zones in the readfile function:
One at 0x0633 with 7 nops.
The second at 0x05CD with 100 nops.

Then, after contemplating suicide for about 3 hours, I successfully patched the file as needed.

The patches do the following:
Patch1 simply jumps to our code at patch2.
Patch2 starts with a jump to skip itself (since we don't want to run it right when the function is called).
The code following the skip loads the base pointer of the string into eax, then moves the first 4 bytes of the string into ebx.
We move the bytes "0x04032123" into ecx, in order to compare the first and second byte of the string to "#" and "!".
If one of the comparisons fails, we abort the patch and simply print the line by jumping to the original print subroutine.
If it doesn't fail, we increase eax by 2 bytes (to skip the "#!" chars), and call system with eax as the parameter.

I am sorry you had to read all of this.
